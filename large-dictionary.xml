      This dictionary is based on the SCOWL (Spelling Correction
      Oriented Word List) made available by Kevin Atkinson. Version 5
      dated January 3, 2003 was used. It combines Kevin Atkinson's word
      lists size 10, size 20, size 35, size 40, size 50 and size
      60. Mark Logic added XML tags to the combined word list to
      conform to the schema used in the system.
